    "In case you've been living under a rock, allow us to introduce you to Taylor Swift, a famous singer, songwriter, and cultural icon. She has set all kinds of records in the music industry, including earning the most American Music Awards in history. She is also the number one most-streamed artist on Spotify, a digital music streaming service, with over 111 billion streams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor Swift's musical style has evolved a lot since her 2006 debut album. In her 2023-2024 global concert tour, *The Eras Tour*, she guided fans through these musical \"eras\". The film version of *The Eras Tour* became the highest-grossing concert film in history in just one weekend when it was released in October 2023.\n",

    "Chances are, you probably have heard some of Taylor Swift's songs; you might even know the words to all of them. In this project, we'll look at Taylor Swift's songs through the lens of data science. We have data on both the lyrics and audio qualities of Taylor Swift's musical body of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we will use contain all songs on each of Taylor Swift's first [eleven studio albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography#Studio_albums). This data was collected before the recent release of her 12th album, *The Life of a Showgirl*, which came out on October 3, 2025. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've chosen to use deluxe or extended versions of these albums when available, to include more songs, but we've eliminated duplicate versions of songs, such as acoustic versions and remixes. We've also chosen to include the rerecorded \"[Taylor's Version](https://www.vox.com/culture/22278732/taylor-swift-re-recording-1989-speak-now-enchanted-mine-master-rights-scooter-braun)\" when available. Our datasets don't include Taylor Swift songs that were released as part of movie soundtracks, live recordings, holiday specials, or through any other mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with two DataFrames throughout the project:\n",
    "- The `lyrics` DataFrame contains the lyrics of each Taylor Swift song.  The data in `lyrics` comes from [Genius](https://genius.com/), \"the world's biggest collection of song lyrics and crowdsourced musical knowledge.\"\n",
    "- The `tswift` DataFrame contains information about the audio features of each song. The data in `tswift` comes from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/). \n",

    "**Question 1.8.** Let's explore the relationship between different variables in the `tswift` dataset. Specifically:\n",
    "- `'Loudness'` is the average loudness of a track measured on a relative scale in decibels. Values typically range between -60 (softer) and 0 (louder).\n",
    "- `'Energy'` is a 0 to 1 scale of a track's activity and intensity, where higher values are more energetic.\n",

    "In the cell below, create a plot that shows the relationship between `'Loudness'` (on the horizontal axis) and `'Energy'` (on the vertical axis) in Taylor Swift's songs. Include an appropriate title. We've included some additional code to draw the best-fitting line to describe the relationship between these variables. We'll learn more about best-fitting lines when we study regression later in the course!"

Since we only have audio features for songs, not albums, we'll calculate the values of an audio feature for an album by averaging the values of that audio feature across all songs on the album. For example, to compute the `'Energy'` of the `'Midnights'` album, we would compute the mean `'Energy'` of all songs on the `'Midnights'` album.\n",

    "Below, complete the implementation of the function `sort_albums_by`, which takes in the column name of an audio feature (e.g. `'Energy'`) and returns an array of the names of all eleven Taylor Swift albums, with the albums sorted in descending order of the given feature. For example, `sort_albums_by('Energy')` would return an array whose first element is the name of the album with the highest mean `'Energy'` across all its songs.\n",

    "We are already familiar with the `tswift` DataFrame; this contains the Taylor Swift songs from which we will make our recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use a separate dataset of allowed input songs. For this, we have a [collection of popular songs with more than one billion streams](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7iB3RCnBnN4) on Spotify. Let's load in this data and store it in the DataFrame `billions_club`. `billions_club` contains all the same columns as `tswift`, except that it doesn't have a `'Year'` column, and it has an additional column named `'Artist'`, because it includes songs by a variety of artists."

This function should calculate the similarity scores between the input song and each of the Taylor Swift songs in `tswift`, one by one, and output an array of similarity scores.  The inputs to `calculate_similarity_for_all` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `input_uri`, the `'URI'` of a song whose features you will compare to each song in `tswift`.\n",

    "Make sure your output array has the similarities of all songs in the order they appear in the `tswift` DataFrame. For example, if the first song in `tswift` is `'Anti-Hero'` (it may not be), then the first element of your output array should be the similarity between the input song and `'Anti-Hero'`.\n",

First, the set of songs we are searching is not exactly the same. Our `lyrics` DataFrame includes all the songs from Taylor Swift's studio albums, and the online search tool includes a few additional songs, like songs from movie soundtracks, plus the songs from *The Life of a Showgirl*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, our search results always include matches where the search term is part of a longer word or phrase, like how `'plan'` is part of `'planets'`. The online search tool handles this more carefully, with options to search for an exact phrase, to include plurals, or to do a wilcard search which is similar to how we've chosen to implement the search. We'll stop here with our lyric searcher, but if you're interested in extending your lyric searcher further, you can try implementing some of these features from the online tool after you submit the project. There are lots of details to consider, such as how to pluralize words (it's not always as simple as adding an `'s'`)!"

You could do that by taking the code you just wrote and changing every instance of `'You Need To Calm Down'` to `'False God'`. Notice that you may get a different value for the term frequency (TF) because the word `'about'` may be more prevalent in one song than another. However, you'd get the same exact value for the inverse document frequency (IDF) because IDF is calculated based only the term (word) not the document (song), as we can see in the formula introduced earlier:\n",

    "Big congratulations on finishing the Midterm Project! 🎉 We hope this experience gave you a taste of what doing data science is really like: frustrating at times, but incredibly satisfying when you produce a finished product you're proud of! If you feeling like telling everyone you know about the cool song recommender you created or the beautiful word clouds you generated, that's a good sign!\n",

    "You're likely a stronger programmer and data scientist now than you were before you started this project, after all the effort you put into completing it. As a reminder of the growth you can achieve through hard work, and the fact that success does not come by accident, here's a spoof of Taylor Swift's song `'Mastermind'` about succeeding in DSC 10. \n",

    "Select `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` to ensure that you have executed all cells, including the test cells.\n",
    "1. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",
    "1. Run the cell below to run all tests, and make sure that they all pass.\n",
    "1. Download your notebook using `File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)`, then upload your notebook to Gradescope. \n",
    "1. If working with a partner, don't forget to add your partner as a group member on Gradescope!\n",
    "1. Stick around while the Gradescope autograder grades your work. Make sure you see that all tests have passed on Gradescope.\n",
    "1. Check that you have a confirmation email from Gradescope and save it as proof of your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "If running all the tests at once causes a test to fail that didn't fail when you ran the notebook in order, check to see if you changed a variable's value later in your code. Make sure to use new variable names instead of reusing ones that are used in the tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the tests here and on Gradescope just check the format of your answers. We will run correctness tests after the due date has passed."
